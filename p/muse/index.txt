* Muse: A tiny site management system

 One of the things I've done sine the beginning wrt [/p/digamma Digamma] is to attempt to dogfood my own work
using Digamma as much as possible. Although this site is tiny, it's still a big pain in the butt managing it, and
anything that I can do to minimize that is helpful. Over the years, I've written multiple site management tools, but
they either felt too heavy, or didn't really do enough of what I wanted. Muse is an attempt to change that. Currently,
it only handles formatting files, taking them from a Org-mode/Muse-mode-like syntax, and translating them into HTML.
Eventually, I'd like to add full site mangement tools to it (like tagging keywords & what not), but I'm starting small.

** Name

 I've been using an "org-mode"-like syntax for... well forever. I've found note books marked up with 

`* some note
- list
- list
- list
* some other note
- repeat`

from 15 years ago (c. 1998). When I originally saw `org-mode`, I thought the syntax looked cool, but I wanted to make
something a bit more light-weight, and less `emacs` focused. I had no idea at the time that there *was* an emacs system
called `Muse` and it was effectively what I was writing here. The format is a bit more strict than `org-mode` or emacs-Muse,
but that's mostly because I was lazy & didn't write a proper parser for the syntax, and instead opted for a push-down
automaton.

** Syntax

The basic syntax is pretty simple:

`* Header 1
** Header 2
*** Header 3

- unordered list 
- unordered list 
- unordered list 

# ordered list
# ordered list
# ordered list

[/link/to/somewhere A URL Link to somwhere]
[!/link/to/image.img Alt-text goes here]

Some formatting: *BOLD* or _ITALIC_

\`code goes here\` 

\`as
does
multi-line
code\` `

Things like &, <, > are handled as expected, and \\ can be used to insert a raw character. There are some forms of hightlighting, such as the
usual things \*BOLD\* and \_ITALIC\_ both work as expected. *However*, in order to avoid confusion, bolds & \`code\` must start *in column 1*. That's
the broken part of using a pushdown automaton for parsing. Of course, I don't expect anyone else to use this, so it's a-ok by me ^\_^. There's also
some table stuff, but there's quite a bit more to do there before I'm really happy with it.

** Future improvements

 Currently, I do most of the linking manually; I'd like to add in some sort of CMS-ish type of system for recording locations. A predecessor to Muse
actually *had* this functionality, but I moved on (I didn't like the internal structure). Certainly, I'd like to be able to categorize things, and
I'd like to update people that the site has been modified via RSS. I _may_ just rip the code out of the old system, and add it back into Muse, so
as to keep things light weight. The previous system also had it's own revision control, which was kinda cool, but I thought that was actually outside
the purview of a simple static site system, so I removed it. Might want to reevaluate that as I add assets to this site.

 Another item I'd like to do is to break the output system down so that I can output Markdown & others directly; I have a sed script that does _most_
of the work toward converting Muse documents to Markdown, so that they can be processed with pandoc, but there's more to be done there.
