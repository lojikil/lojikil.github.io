# Tiny Languages

these are some of the languages I worked on throughout my "programming" life, in some semblance of reverse chronological order:

- carML: a yummy and sweet ML-dialect, [which lives on github](https://github.com/lojikil/carML)
- 101lisp: "lisp" dialect that uses AVL trees as list store and unifies environments, lists and code into more malleable blob.
- SmallSapphire: Self-ish Ruby.
- ReTread: a stack based language for wargaming (i.e. tiny language that could call execve &amp; friends, and small enough to UUE &amp; make copypasta)
- Phantom: a more user/kid friendly tatwyd, with things like infix arithmetic.
- tatwyd: a Logo-dialect that was highly influenced by PowerLOGO, Scheme, and the disaster that was mikroCL
- Sampi: stack-based logic language, that unified via stack.
- Heta: X-Query meets Triangle/Tiger.
- HoMiLy: a Homoiconic ML using Prolog-style syntax.
- Digamma/PreDigamma: "production-focused" Scheme dialect. My longest run & largest personal project, [also lives on GitHub](https://github.com/lojikil/digamma)
- Chickadee: an improved stack 'em with more Forth-isms.
- Skink: tiny Draca-dialect meant to get boot strap off the ground.
- Draca: an Algol68-ish dialect of Draco (itself an Algol68-alike for Amiga iirc).
- bfalgol: dead-simple Algol=&gt;brainfuck compiler, written for a competition at work.
- Chai: Dylan + Io + MUSH-style permissions; [example.chai example.chai]
- clocc: C + Dylan
- Cactus+: Cactus was a language I found on BeBits that had an APL-ish feel, so I wrote a version myself with more J/K/Q-isms. [Now live on GitHub!](https://github.com/lojikil/cactusp)
- Fly: a second attempt at Rexx + Lua
- Orion: a language combining Rexx & Lua
- stack 'em: Joy-like stack language that attempted to add Scheme-style syntax. Was really messy.
- muForth: a super minimal Forth dialect with some Joy mixed in [Found my old design document for it](muforth.html)
- muCL/mikroCL: a mini-TCL, with Lispisms, [an old broken version of which lives on GitHub](https://github.com/lojikil/mutcl)
- Vladi: A simple lisp dialect created for my Brother in law
- tttl: tiny text testing language; an awk-alike I wrote at a company so that users could run awk-like reports without a full language.
- muPascal: my first language; bootstrap compiler written in QBasic.
