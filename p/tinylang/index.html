    <h4>Tiny Languages</h4>
    <p>these are some of the languages I worked on throughout my "programming" life, in some semblance of reverse chronological order</p>
    <ul>
      <li>101lisp: "lisp" dialect that uses AVL trees as list store and unifies environments, lists and code into more malleable blob.</li>
      <li>SmallSapphire: Self-ish Ruby.</li>
      <li>Digamma/PreDigamma: "production-focused" Scheme dialect. My longest run &amp; largest personal project</li>
      <li>Phantom: a more user/kid friendly tatwyd, with things like infix arithmetic.</li>
      <li>tatwyd: a Logo-dialect that was highly influenced by PowerLOGO, Scheme, and the disaster that was mikroCL</li>
      <li>Sampi: stack-based logic language, that unified via stack.</li>
      <li>Heta: X-Query meets Triangle/Tiger.</li>
      <li>HoMiLy: a Homoiconic ML using Prolog-style syntax.</li>
      <li>Chickadee: an improved stack 'em with more Forth-isms.</li>
      <li>stack 'em: Joy-like stack language that attempted to add Scheme-style syntax. Was really messy.</li>
      <li>Skink: tiny Draca-dialect meant to get boot strap off the ground.</li>
      <li>Draca: an Algol68-ish dialect of Draco (itself an Algol68-alike for Amiga iirc).</li>
      <li>Cactus+: Cactus was a language I found on BeBits that had an APL-ish feel, so I wrote a version myself with more J/K/Q-isms.</li>
      <li>muCL/mikroCL: a mini-TCL, with Lispisms.</li>
      <li>tttl: tiny text testing language; an awk-alike I wrote at a company so that users could run awk-like reports without a full language.</li>
      <li>muPascal: my first language; bootstrap compiler written in QBasic.</li>
      <li>
    </ul>
