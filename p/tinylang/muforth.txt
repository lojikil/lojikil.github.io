So, this is the design document I wrote for myself when I was... 15 or so. It's clear to me that
it wasn't really fleshed out, but it's kinda neat to see. I should find the code on this one, to
see what it needs to fully implement this... Oh, I see, this is from my Joy period; there was a time
when I was obsessed with [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joy_(programming_language) Joy]. That's what I 
must have been going for, at least what I think. Oh, and the note down at the bottom... Of course, at 
the time I enjoyed doing things in the most strange way possible, so I can see it, but still...

`muForth:
    ! grab value from vstatck & load the blocked pointed to that value onto the vstack.
        *Note*: this is _not_ destructive
    @ grab value from the vstack & store the value to the block pointed to by that value.
        e.g.: 4 0 @
        stores 4 at block 0
    + adds the top two elements of vstack
    - subtracts the top two elements of vstack
    / divides the top two elements of vstack
    * multiplies the top two elements of vstack
    % modulus the top two values of vstack
    > checks if the top two are greater than
    >= checks if the top two are greater than or equal to
    < checks if the top two are less than
    <= checks if the top two are less than or equal to
    = checks if top two are equal
    != checks if top two are not equal
    zero checks if the top is zero
    ? evalues the 1st element on cstack if vstack[top] == 1; else eval(cstack[top - 1])
    dup duplicates top of the vstack
    drop removes the top element of vstack
    nip removes the 2nd element of vstack
    over copies the 2nd element of the top of vstack
    tuck copies the 1st element to below the 3rd
    swap swaps the top two elements
    rotate rotates the top three elements
    clear cleares the vstack
    cclear clears the cstack
    println prints the top of the stack + '\n'
    print prints the top of the stack only
    read reads a value into the top of the stack
    readstr reads a value onto the top of cstack
    dump prints the contents of vstack
    cdump prints the contents of cstack
    eval evalues the top of cstack as muForth words
    def defines a new word
    peek uses the top of the stack as a value to peek into the stack
    depth places the length of the stack on top

Examples:
    Input 0:
    read read > [ "Input one greater than input two" println ] [ "input two greater than input one" ] ?
    Output 0:
    value> 4
    value> 5
    Input two greater than input one

    Input 1:
    [ @ ] store def [ ! ] retrieve def 4 0 store 0 retrieve println

    Output 1:

    4

    Explaination 1:
    defines two new words: store (a replacement for @) & retrieve (a replacement for !), then stores 4
    at block 0 and retrieves it to print.

Notes:
    I can do this as a single stack of type string evaluating data inline.`
