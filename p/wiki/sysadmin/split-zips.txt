* Splitting and Splicing Zip files from the CLI

This is [http://superuser.com/questions/365643/how-to-unzip-split-files-on-os-x from this SuperUser question]. Basically:

- To split: `zip -s 100m -x "*.DS_Store" -r split-foo.zip foo/` where `100m` is the size to split on.
- To splice: `zip -s 0 split-foo.zip --out unsplit-foo.zip`, which can then be unzipped normally: `unzip unsplit-foo.zip`

Super useful (and something I didn't know, but had to figure out since I had to split zips for a client to email...)
