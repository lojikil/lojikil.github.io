<p>So, this is one of my more, uh, interesting adventures.</p>
<p>Basically, my laptop at <em>work</em> (edit: spelling; thanks Lord of the Dance!) died, and our fear-less admin (and resident Lord of the Dance) requested that I try Western Digital’s hard disk analyzer. Well, interestingly enough, that utility requires a FreeDOS install, which I put on a spare 1GiB USB stick. Well, that got me thinking: what else can I do with a spare FreeDOS install? Well, I can put FreePascal on it! That would make it super useful!</p>
<p>So, thus armed, I set out to write some neat stuff for FreeDOS… and promptly hit a wall: the FreePascal IDE wouldn’t load! I don’t recall what the error was, but naturally my next step was to check if the <em>compiler</em> would work, which it did. “Well, that should be enough…”</p>
<p>My First step was a simple “hello world!” type of program:</p>
<pre><code>program foo;
begin
    writeln(&quot;Hello, world&quot;);
end.</code></pre>
<p>Can you spot the bug? Suffice it to say that I haven’t written Pascal in some time, &amp; forgot that Strings are <code>' '</code> delimited rather than <code>" "</code> delimited; the above was quickly followed by:</p>
<pre><code>program bar;
begin
    writeln(&#39;Hello, world!&#39;);
end.</code></pre>
<p>The fun part about this is that I wrote them line-by-line using <code>GECHO</code>; the built in DOS-echo didn’t handle strings properly.</p>
<p>(Although, thinking about it, I wonder if I could have used something like <code>TYPE CON</code>… Have to try that later). Basically I wrote way too many lines of:</p>
<pre><code>C:\\WORK&gt;\\fpc\\bin\\go32v2\\gecho &quot;program foo;&quot; &gt; foo.pas
C:\\WORK&gt;\\fpc\\bin\\go32v2\\gecho &quot;begin&quot; &gt;&gt; foo.pas
...</code></pre>
<p>As you may imagine, that was slow going :D</p>
<p>Having written a “Hello, world” that I could compile, my next thought was to write something akin to <code>cat</code>, where it would read from <code>STDIN</code> (or <code>Input</code> in Pascal) and write to <code>STDOUT</code>. I don’t know if I screwed something up, but <code>EOF</code> was <em>not</em> working for me (I would hit <code>^Z</code> and it would keep going; I probably mistyped something), so my <code>cat</code> replacement reads until it hits <code>.</code> byitself on a line, like <code>ed</code> does:</p>
<pre><code>program dog(input, output);
var s: string;
begin
    readln(s);
    while s &lt;&gt; &#39;.&#39; do 
    begin
        writeln(s);
        readln(s);
    end;
end.</code></pre>
<p>The code is simple, and I hand formatted it, but mostly so that I could attempt to read it later. Personally, I like the <em>idea</em> of Pascal/Algol, but I do find the lack of symbols a bit disorienting at times, so I <em>do</em> like to have it nicely formatted.</p>
<p>Armed with <em>that</em> code, I set out to write a simple prompt test:</p>
<pre><code>program prompttest(input, output);
var
    s : string;
begin
    write(&#39;&gt; &#39;);
    readln(s);
    while s &lt;&gt; &#39;q&#39; do
    begin
        writeln(&#39;s is &#39;, s);
        write(&#39;&gt; &#39;);
        readln(s);
    end;
end.</code></pre>
<p>Having written that, I finally set out to write a very basic editor, which I dubbed “ZDLIN”. I can’t tell you how many times I had to type this in; after getting the <code>p</code> and <code>i</code> commands to work, it was a devil of a time to retype the whole thing in order to add commands. I was thinking about adding a handful of other small utilities, like <code>head</code> and <code>tail</code>, to help with the process, but eventually I just soldiered on &amp; wrote it out:</p>
<pre><code>program zdlin(input, output);
uses
    Classes, SysUtils;
var
    buffer : TStringList;
    line, src : string;
    idx, tmp0, tmp1, tmp2 : integer;
begin
    buffer := TStringList.create;
    src := ParamStr(1);
    buffer.LoadFromFile(src);
    idx := buffer.count - 1;
    write(&#39;&gt; &#39;);
    readln(line);
    while line &lt;&gt; &#39;q&#39; do
    begin
        if line = &#39;p&#39; then
        begin
            if idx &gt; 0 then
            begin

                    writeln(buffer[tmp0]);
                end;
            end;

            Val(line, tmp0, tmp1);
            buffer.delete(tmp0);
            Dec(idx);

            Val(line, tmp1, tmp2);
            for tmp2 := tmp0 to tmp1 do
            begin
                buffer.delete(tmp0); // buffer shrinks each time
            end;
            idx := buffer.count - 1;
        end
        else if line = &#39;I&#39; then

            end;

        end

<p>As you can see, there is no command parsing what so ever; commands are simply <code>p</code> or <code>P</code>, and the user is then prompted for any other parameters as necessay. Though basic, it <em>should</em> be enough to implement [https://twitter.com/bigthingist/status/454454027418230784 Bigthingist’s] idea, and make something more visual. Of course, as I replied, I <em>would</em> be interested in trying to make something [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_(text_editor) Sam-like] as a test. And, of course, I’d like to make a Digamma Runtime; Retargetting Enyalios for FreePascal shouldn’t be <em>too</em> difficult; I’d be more concerned about it being too large for memory though :D</p>
