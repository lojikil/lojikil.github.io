    <h1>Digamma: my attempt at "Lisp for the 21st Century"</h1>
    <p style="font-weight: bold">Current Vesta Stable Release: 6.7-alpha</p>
    <p style="font-weight: bold">Current Vesta WIP release: none</p>
    <p style="font-weight: bold">Current Hydra release: 0.1-alpha</p>
    <p>Digamma is a dialect of scheme that provides several advanced features:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Dictionary literals in a ruby/python style: {:test 1 :dictionary 2}</li>
      <li>Quoted vector literals using [ ] </li>
      <li>Dictionaries are backed by tries, and keys can be queried as to matches or length match</li>
      <li>Applicable data structures</li>
      <li>Levels of specification, to allow Digamma to be implemented everywhere</li>
      <li>A PreScheme-like restricted dialect that allows for Systems-level programming</li>
      <li>W7-like environments for safe code evalution in programmatically created environments</li>
      <li>A Collection API (first,rest,cset!,nth,cupdate) that applies a purely-functional style to all collections (lists, dicts, vectors, strings)</li>
      <li>Various interfaces to lambdas: case-based (CaML/Haskell-style), Keyword (Python/extended SRFI-89 style), CL (with :rest, :opt, :body, &amp;c.) &amp; standard.</li>
      <li>Strong specificty of POSIX interactions, to avoid the normally academic feel of Scheme dialects.</li>
      <li>a "batteries included" approach to library inclusion, with a focus on real-world requirements (SMTP, HTTP, IMAP, Pop3, pentration testing, &amp;c.</li>
      <li>Work in Progress: types ala Stalin</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It comes in a few flavors:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Vesta: the reference implementation written in C</li>
      <li>Hydra: the work in progress, which is meant to replace Vesta eventually, and self-hosts. Compiles Digamma to a SECD-like VM.</li>
      <li>Enyalios: a "Pre-Digamma" compiler (restricted subset) which is meant to be a better compilation framework than E' (Eprime)</li>
      <li>Eprime/E': the initial Digamma -&gt; Compiler, which was shelved because working on it was painful. Enyalios is a complete rewrite and meant to be extensible.</li>
      <li>Nyx/Aneris: simple test interpreters to try out self-hosting interpreters, but are AST walkers.</li>
      <li>Ceres: a register-VM that was shelved (then started again, then shelved...).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Vesta Release history</p>
    <ul>
      <li>6.7-alpha: fixes, consistency, &amp;c.</li>
      <li>6.6-theta: efficiency tuning of TCO, W7 &amp; define-syntax overhaul</li>
      <li>6.6-eta: true TCO, help, docstrings</li>
      <li>6.6-zeta: testing release</li>
      <li>6.6-delta: major re-organization of internals, many, many bug fixes</li>
      <li>6.6-gamma: prelude/init.ss work, internals, better display from FORMAT</li>
      <li>6.6-beta: over-haul of collexions (tries, tconcs, cslice), removal of certain primitives that could be implemented in higher-level forms (like cond) and switch of internal Environment storage format (mixture of Linked lists &amp; tries)</li>
      <li>6.6-alpha: switched from lleval (old, recursive style) to _seval (stackless version), and removed debugging</li>
      <li>6.5-gamma: added _seval (stackless) and switched primitives to use this stack</li>
      <li>6.5-beta: start of stackless system, bug fixes to lleval</li>
      <li>6.5-alpha: changes to closure application</li>
      <li>6.4: aborted attempt at better internal organization (aborted because it became very messy; premature optimization root of all evil :D)</li>
      <li>6.3: bug fixes, multiple changes</li>
      <li>6.2: stablized read system</li>
      <li>&lt;= 6.1: ancient stuff</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Hydra Release History</p>
    <ul>
      <li>0.1-beta: cleaned up instruction set a bit, to reduce number of instructions needed.</li>
      <li>0.1-alpha: finalized the basic instruction set.</li>
      <li>0.0-gamma: continuations working nicely.</li>
      <li>0.0-beta: fixed accidental scope breakage.</li>
      <li>0.0-alpha: basic proof-of-concept fork from Nyx/Aneris.</li>
    </ul>
