<p>I’ve spent a few hours here and there over the last month implementing a part of REXX in a strange fashion; I didn’t really get to the point where I can run a ton of code, but I consider the experiment a success anyway.</p>
<h1 id="_what_was_i_thinking">what was I thinking?</h1>
<p>So, I had a few weird goals:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I wanted to lean in to REXX’s "instructions" and make the most minimal interpreter possible.</p></li>
<li><p>I wanted to actually <em>learn REXX</em>, which is something I’ve not spent time doig much of before.</p></li>
<li><p>I also wanted to do basically <strong>no</strong> parsing at all. None.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This part I failed fully, since I ended up parsing certain types of expressions.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Minimize my usage of git and learn more about RCS</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The real background was that Advent of Code was only 12 days this year, so it seemed like a fun time to try something else; I thought <a href="https://langjamgamejam.com/">LangJamGameJam</a> sounded interesting, but I wanted to be a bit more expansive. It’s lead me to reading books on PL/I and diving deep into the background on Rexx, which has been a ton of fun; I’ve coded myself into a corner with a single-file implementation, but that is mostly because I didn’t truly understand the level of dynamicism of Rexx prior to starting. I will likely try again, but with a better understanding of what I’m getting into.</p>
<h1 id="_why_rexx">why REXX?</h1>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rexx">Rexx</a> is an interesting language: it’s older, and it’s syntax predates many common conventions we see in other languages. It also has a fairly interesting use case: it’s not quite a scripting language, but it also isn’t really meant to be used far away from the operating system either. In Rexx, any string evaluated at the top level (roughly) is treated as a shell command, making OS interaction fairly trivial. At the same time, strings are pretty easy to come by: two expressions next to one another "abut," which effectively concatenates their output. So <code>"ls " some_args some_dir</code> will abut, and pull the values of <code>some_dir</code> and <code>some_arg</code> into a string to be executed by the operating system.</p>
<p>This "abutting" operator confused me at first! You see, when you write a procedure or a subroutine, you have two options:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>call <code>parse arg…​</code> and give a format specification of the arguments.</p></li>
<li><p>use the <code>arg</code> function to retrieve and parse arguments seprated by commas.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So, how did this cause confusion? Well, consider the following:</p>
<pre><code>call foo 1 2 3
call foo 1, 2, 3</code></pre>
<p>Both of these succeed! And indeed, you can easily write around either calling style, but it wasn’t until later that I realized that the first is effectively "abutting" the values into a single string, and the second was processing three values; I thought <strong>both</strong> were just single strings that were processed later. Understanding it now, I get the issue, but I had already painted myself into a corner; I’ll likely still fix it, but it’s more work than I would want for a simple "fun" project meant to understand a language I haven’t used before.</p>
<h1 id="_why_regexs">why RegExs?</h1>
<p>Well, I’ve never actually used the POSIX regex API directly myself; I’ve used lots of tooling that only uses BREs or EREs, but I myself have never used the API. This lead me to an interesting thought:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Rexx doesn’t have syntax per se, but Instructions.</p></li>
<li><p>If I made these Instructions fit on one line, then I could easily parse them with RegExes.</p></li>
<li><p>This would be a fun excuse to learn the POSIX regex API.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Which is really the long and the short of it: it was an interesting attempt at minimalism. I think if I were to start over (which I will), I’d keep the regexes I wrote, and simply fix my Instruction layout to have only Instructions and SubInstructions, instead of partially evaluated strings for some things and expressions for others. Additionally, I’d make a high level "machine" that operated on this instructions, instead of a sort of microexecutor. It’ll be interesting to revisit in a bit.</p>
<h1 id="_without_git">…​ without git?</h1>
<p>I’ve really been thinking about the ecosystems that I use of late. One thing to know about me is that I often use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_Control_System">RCS</a> for simple version control: if I need to control a single file, I’ll use RCS instead of Git. I also read <a href="https://archive.org/details/applyingrcssccs00boli">Applying RCS and SCCS</a> recently, for just the sheer interest, and it made me think again about how and why I use version control.</p>
<p>I didn’t actually always use git; prior to git, I was a heavy darcs user in my personal projects, and had a mono-repo I kept updated with various projects from 2004 until I switched to git fully in 2010 or so. I also was a heavy svn user for work, so git was hardly my first foray into version control, even in a distributed fashion. However, something about git has always struck me as wrong; it feels too disjointed, unsafe, and low level. There’s only a handful of people I trust to <code>rebase</code> something correctly and the very notion always struck me as an abstraction leak. I also tend to not work in very "clean" trees: I make little commits to work areas/trees, and then roll those up into one giant PR/MR. For personal projects, I tend not to care if tip is broken, because so often I’m the sole users of my software anyway. So, I wanted to try using something that was different, supported work areas by default, and could grow from individual files to whole projects. Looking aroud, it seems like <a href="https://www.gameoftrees.org/">Game of Trees</a> is the most similar to what I’m thinking, but eventually what I would like is:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>GNU/TL arch style "repo" is a top level place where you keep all code.</p></li>
<li><p>Projects are individual directories or files within the repo that may have different storage locations externally.</p></li>
<li><p>Work areas (or trees) are relatively easy, and represent a checked out version of a project.</p></li>
<li><p>Modication Requests (SCCS), Pull/Merge Requests should be first class values to the project itself.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Also, I’m just tired of GitHub, GitLab, &amp;c. They are still cool places to find neat projects, but I’ve sorta stopped wanting to work in a corporate planned community and sorta work in an <em>ecology</em>: what is the ecosystem of softare that Loji needs, and how can he share bits of technology from the same with others? Increasingly, I don’t think it’s FLOSS writ large, at least not for me.</p>
<h1 id="_wrapping_up">wrapping up</h1>
<p>So, I:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Learnt two new programming languages (I ended up reading three books on PL/I as well haha).</p></li>
<li><p>Actually used the POSIX regex API for something interesting.</p></li>
<li><p>Refined more of what I wanted out of my version control usage.</p></li>
<li><p>Complete failed at writing a full interpreter for the language.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>but had a lot of fun doing so.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>I think this is the model I sorta want to have from now on: after Advent of Code, spend the downtime of the winter season in new areas that are interesting, away from work.</p>
