<h1 id="_thoughts_on_writing_2000_lines_of_coastml">thoughts on writing 2000 lines of coastML</h1>
<p><a href="https://github.com/lojikil/coastML">coastML</a> is a new, tiny ML dialect I’ve been working on for a year and half. Honestly, in some ways it’s meant to be done (in the same way that StandardML is "done"): I’d like to get to some point where I’m happy with the core features and specify the language at that point. I don’t <em>want</em> to be focused on fancy new features, but rather I’d like something similar to <a href="https://www.simplehaskell.org/">SimpleHaskell</a> and ReasonML: a full-featured programming language meant for regular problems, and output that is nice enough to deliver to other people who don’t want to deal with coastML.</p>
<p>Lately, I’ve been working on a self-hosting compiler for coastML; I had become frustrated with <a href="https://github.com/lojikil/coastML/issues/4">some bugs I had introduced</a> in the Carpet Python compiler, and wanted to refocus on making a better system (read: I wanted to make new and exciting bugs). So far, I’ve written about 1.2k lines of coastML for the compiler, and another 800 lines or so of misc. other code; I figured that was a good point to start comparing the two.</p>
<h1 id="_the_good">The Good</h1>
<p>I’m pretty happy with the way that the compiler has been shaking out; I’ve basically been writing relatively simple code to parse structures, and using the Foreign Function Interface (FFI) to use the Python lexer to do so (more on this later). The result is pretty nice; I’m able to write fairly straight-forward code, that parses features:</p>
<pre><code>parse-lambda = fn lexer {
        # whilst this is simple enough, it would be
        # very nice to have a Monadic interface here,
        # so that we could easily compose these three lines
        params = optionally-parse-params lexer;
        body = parse-block (TokenList.Nil) lexer;
        SandCityAST.FnBody params body;
};</code></pre>
<p>We have two different data constructors in use here, namely <code>SandCityAST.FnBody</code> and <code>TokenList.Nil</code>, and we pass a <code>lexer</code> object around for reading lexemes out of a string. Compare this with the original Carpet Python version:</p>

<p>They’re both pretty simple (although <code>parse_fn</code> inlines the parameter parsing), and decently terse. I’m sure error handling will add some noise in here, but I think we can get to a point where errors are nicely composed in a monadic style. The nice thing about all this is that, although, for example, parsing <code>case</code> forms is 105 lines (including documentation) in coastML versus 58 in Python, I’ve managed to <strong>both</strong> <a href="https://github.com/lojikil/coastML/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3Abug+label%3Acarpet">fix multiple bugs in Carpet Python</a> and <a href="https://github.com/lojikil/coastML/issues/8">expand the language to where I’d like it</a>. The new compiler is almost at parity with Carpet Python, meaning it can parse the same code the same way and already has started expanding on other features of the language that I’d like to see. For example, we’ll add a new <code>fun</code> form which I believe makes the language a bit more clear and we’ll get modules going next. I’d like to keep Carpet Python around for bootstrapping the self-hosted compiler, but I expect users (me, myself, and I) will mainly use the self-hosted one. Additionally, since I wrote this more in the style of classical Recursive Descent Parsers, and less like an imperative parsing stream as I did in Carpet Python, adding new features means I can reuse old lambdas, and often do. All told, I’ve been pretty happy with the results.</p>
<h1 id="_the_bad">The Bad</h1>
<p>I think the two major pain points I’ve seen will be fixed soon enough, but they come in the form of two things: primitive FFI and primitive error handling.</p>
<p>The FFI in coastML is relatively simple currently: the user may invoke lambdas like <code>foreign-call</code> and <code>foreign-object-type</code> to interact with the underlying system (which is mainly Python at this point, although ostensibly JavaScript should be supported as well). However, these are quite low-level: <code>foreign-call</code> simple takes a string and rewrites it to a call with parameters in the resulting output, and <code>foreign-object-type</code> uses mechanisms such as <code>foo.type</code> to return a string of the object type. This means that the self-hosting compiler is littered with code that looks like the following:</p>
<pre><code>token = foreign-call &quot;lexer.peek&quot;;
token-type = foreign-object-type token;
case token-type
....
esac;</code></pre>
<p>This is caused by the fact that I don’t yet have a great way of mapping hierarchies of types to coastML, so we end up with a stringly-typed interface instead. I’d like to fix that going forward, by being able to either parse the underlying type or be able to recreate the type in coastML <code>type</code> definitions, but with a "foreign" rewriting.</p>
<p>Error handling, on the other side, is mostly due to the fact that I’m using Carpet Python, and the self-hosting compiler needs to work within the boundaries of what it can do. For example:</p>
<pre><code>type Result[A B]
| Ok is [A]
| Err is [B]
epyt;

v = some-fn ...;
case v
| (Result.Ok _) {
    inner-v = _0 v;
    case inner-v
    ...
    esac
}
| (Result.Err) {
    ...
}</code></pre>
<p>There are two issues with the above: <code>case</code> forms in Carpet Python don’t actually yet decompose, so guards have to either be a complete function call out (turning the <code>case</code> into a <code>cond</code> effectively) <strong>or</strong> you have to nest <code>case</code> forms like I did above. The second issue is that Carpet Python cannot actually tell the arity of a data type constructor, so you can have things like <code>(Result.Err)</code>, which has zero paremeters, when in fact we know that it should have one from the above definition. I’d like to get to some point where we can thread <code>orElse</code> or the like through out, or even just plain fully-monadic interfaces, but for the time being it’s a limitation I have to work with. One thought I’ve had is that it would be interesting if the self-hosting compiler could take "modern" coastML and output coastML that is compatible with Carpet Python, but I think I may just focus on making better output from the self-hosting compiler.</p>
<h1 id="_the_shape_of_the_next_2000_lines_to_come">The shape of the next 2000 lines to come</h1>
<p>There is a <strong>lot</strong> more to do in the self-hosting compiler; I’m finishing up <code>type</code> forms, at which point it will be at parity with being able to parse coastML with where Carpet Python is, and then I can focus on adding new features. Honestly, the next two thousand lines of coastML almost certainly will be spent within the self-hosting compiler. My current burn-down list looks something like:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>❏ parse <code>type</code> forms (almost done)</p></li>
<li><p>❏ parse:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>❏ <code>fc</code> (case lambdas)</p></li>
<li><p>❏ <code>gn</code> (multi-method lambdas)</p></li>
<li><p>❏ <code>fun</code> (slightly more explicit syntax)</p></li>
<li><p>❏ <code>mod</code></p></li>
<li><p>❏ <code>sig</code></p></li>
<li><p>❏ <code>impl</code> (type class implementations)</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>❏ a nicer FFI</p></li>
<li><p>review some nice to haves (like nicer <code>type</code> constructor syntax)</p></li>
<li><p>review adding <code>deriving</code> and base-constructors to <code>type</code> forms</p></li>
<li><p>❏ literate programming tool</p></li>
<li><p>❏ documentation tooling more broadly (<code>doc</code>)</p></li>
<li><p>❏ Hoare Logic (<code>invariant</code>, <code>pre</code>, <code>post</code>, <code>assert</code>, and so on)</p></li>
<li><p>❏ A <a href="https://github.com/trailofbits/deepstate">DeepState</a>-like testing tool, so:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>❏ unit testing framework</p></li>
<li><p>❏ fuzzer/shrinker</p></li>
<li><p>❏ symbolic path explorer (with concretizing via the above, as well as a simple CAS)</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>❏ a Computer Algebra System (CAS), as well as some algorithms for general work</p>
<ul>
<li><p>if you’re wondering why a CAS so early, it’s so that I can cheat on symbolic execution (symbex) with light-weight symbex via CAS</p></li>
</ul></li>
