== five months of coastal living: coastML at four months

Today marks five months of coastal living; let's checkout the running burndown chart:

* [x] assignments
* [x] functions
* [x] `case` forms
** [x] thread assignments into `case` forms (e.g. `a = case x ...` becomes `case x | ... { a = ... }`)
** [x] `case` forms within other forms, such as function calls
* [x] `type` forms
* [x] Python generation
* [x] decomposition in `case` forms
** [x] including pattern matching
** [ ] array pattern matching
** [ ] string pattern matching (this could get interesting...)
* [x] accessors (both variables and lambdas) for `type`
* [ ] `gn` forms
* [ ] `fc` forms
** Still *so* on the fence about these...
* [ ] `mod` and `sig` forms
* [ ] an analog to SML's `op`, using backticks
* [ ] basis library (stubbed out, need to actually compile)
** [x] basic basis stubs: some members of `+array-*+`, `+string-*+` have been stubbed out
*** [x] array-length
*** [x] array-get
*** [x] array-set!
*** [x] array-make
*** [x] array-init
*** [x] array-make-matrix
*** [x] array-append
*** [x] array-append!
*** [ ] array-concat
*** [ ] array-concat!
*** [x] array-sub
*** [x] array-copy
*** [ ] array-fill!
*** [ ] array-blit!
*** [ ] array->list
*** [ ] list->array
*** [x] array-iter
*** [x] array-map
*** [x] array-iter-index
*** [x] array-map-index
*** [ ] array-foldl
*** [ ] array-foldr
*** [ ] array-sort
*** [x] array-sort!
*** [ ] array-stable-sort
*** [ ] array-fast-sort
*** [x] string-length
*** [x] string-get
*** [ ] string-make
*** [ ] string-init
*** [x] string-split
*** [x] string-append
*** [ ] string-join
*** [ ] string-contains
*** [ ] string-concat
*** [ ] string-copy
*** [ ] string->array
*** [x] string-iter
*** [x] string-map
*** [x] string-iter-index
*** [ ] string-map-index
*** [ ] string-foldl
*** [ ] string-foldr
*** [x] string-sort
*** [ ] compare
*** [ ] char-code
*** [ ] char-chr
*** [ ] char-escaped
*** [ ] char-lowercase
*** [ ] char-uppercase
*** [ ] char-compare
*** More of the OS interaction stuff out of https://reasonml.github.io/api/Pervasives.html[the Pervasives API]
** [ ] basis library modules (modular forms, e.g. `array-get` becomes `Array::get`)
* [ ] support for the `is` form
* [ ] code generation
** [ ] C 
** [ ] C++
** [ ] Go
** [x] Python
* [ ] type inference
* [ ] refinement types
* [ ] a compiler
** [ ] lambda lifter
** [ ] closure conversion
** [ ] `pragma` to control certain aspects of compilation
** [ ] checking of accessors prior to compilation
** [ ] value restriction for `ref` types
* bugs fixed
** [x] nested arrays `[[[1] [2]] [[3] [4]]]`
** [x] missing `/` character in identifier/operator character sets
** [x] floating point numbers with two integral digits (e.g. `0.12` and `1.12` worked but not `10.12`)
*** this was noticed when attempting to write some software to generate https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_day[Julian dates]
*** https://www.subsystems.us/uploads/9/8/9/4/98948044/moonphase.pdf[Was the calculation sheet I was using]
** [x] `return` logic
** [x] indentation of blocks
** [x] missing `bool` type
** [x] parsing `type` definitions that have other complex types in them
** [x] munging idents (ex: `julian-date` becomes `julian_date`)
** [x] stripping comments prior to output
*** really need to handle these so that we can output them into the compiled language, but for now this suffices
** [x] `return` prepended to forms that are rewritten to `for` loops
** [x] fix spacing between `class` forms in Python output
** [x] fixed bugs with parsing & displaying characters
** [ ] `case` forms at the start of a `(call)` form are assumed to be functions instead of evaluated for a lambda
*** `(case ... | 10 { " " } | _ { "nope" } esac ...)` is assumed to be a lambda already... whoops
** [ ] `case` forms in a function call in assignment clobbers the assignment
*** ex: `+a = string-split-char ':' case (OS::getenv "PATH") | (Result.Some s) { s } | (Result.None) { "" } esac;+`
*** produces `a = res1 = ...` which is obviously in correct
** [x] destructuring binds didn't actually apply a `.format` correctly
