<p>I started coastML <a
href="https://github.com/lojikil/coastML/tree/505f69d6848010f0b5679174bc90be5b3fdbac07">about
two years ago now,</a> and I figured this would be an apt time to
solidify more of what I’m thinking. So:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>current status</p></li>
<li><p>next steps</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>CalVer</p></li>

</ol>
<h1 id="_current_status_or_where_the_sea_meets_the_shore">current
status, or, where the sea meets the shore</h1>
<p>coastML may <strong>look</strong> like not much has been happening,
at least in the public repository. However, I’ve been working on a
private self-hosted compiler. There’s a few things here:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>I wanted to take a step back and actually think about how I could
organize a compiler in coastML itself</p></li>
<li><p>I’ve never really written a industrial-grade compiler in an
ML-style language before (but have multiple times in Lisp)</p></li>
<li><p>I honestly started to loathe working in coastML’s Python
implementation</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>which almost made me want to give up</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>One thing I promised myself with coastML is that I want to live up to
the motto: come relax on the coast, stay a while. I didn’t want to
stress over something like not loving the Python compiler and I really
wanted to deliver something. So I’m about 230 commits into a new
compiler that I hope to release soon; it fixes a number of bugs that
I’ve found in Carpet Python (the coastML Python implementation) and is
written in the small dialect that is already implemented there.
Additionally, it adds features that I wish Carpet Python had, and is
much stricter towards my vision of what coastML should be. For
example:</p>
<pre><code>foo = fn x y { x + y } 10 20;</code></pre>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>in Carpet Python, this is a compiler error: it generates a
function, <code>foo</code>, and then a compiler error attempting to
apply a literal</p></li>
<li><p>in the new compiler, this results in an anonymous function
application, meaning <code>foo</code> should be equal to 30</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>eventually I’d like this to be compiled down further, but neither
here nor there</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>Which is great; several small bugs like this are fixed in the new
compiler. Of course, that also means that we could have a parser
differential: things could be executed differently in the new compiler
from the old one. There are a few things here:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>the dialect that Carpet Python accepts is a subset of the full
coastML</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>literally nothing in Carpet Python isn’t valid coastML, it’s just
not the full language</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>the new compiler is written in this dialect</p></li>
<li><p>since it’s a subset of the full language, it can parse both this
dialect and the full coastML</p></li>
</ol>
<p>I’ve definitely been in the <a
href="https://course.ccs.neu.edu/cs5500f14/Notes/Prototyping1/planToThrowOneAway.html">Mythical
Man Month "expect to throw one away"</a> space for some time now. Once
the new compiler is ready, I want to do the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>hook it into the <code>coastml</code> shell script as the
top-level compiler</p></li>
<li><p>rename the Carpet Python compiler work to something like
<code>reboot</code> (since no one should need this unless they’re
working on the new compiler)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>plan on working on the next compiler</strong></p></li>
</ol>
<p>I really do mean that: once this compiler is finished, I want to use
it to boot an actual industrial-grade compiler; Carpet Python is
something of a tinkerer grade, and the new compiler is something of an
artisan grade, so the next I’d like regular folks to be able to use
without thinking much of it.</p>
<h1 id="_next_steps_or_that_brackish_line_in_the_water">next steps, or,
that brackish line in the water</h1>
<p>so where do we go from here?</p>
<h2 id="_calver">CalVer</h2>
<p>One thing I’ve been thinking about is, I don’t want coastML to change
a lot; in fact, I’d really like it to be <strong>done</strong>. That’s
not to say "dead," but rather I don’t want to spend most of my time
solely working on coastML: I’d really like to get a neat set of features
together and then work on other software. This likely won’t be done for
years to come, but at least it’s a goal. Additionally, I don’t want
coastML to become a cutting edge programming language, per se: I’d much
rather work on features that users can actually use <strong>right
now</strong>, and then make adjustments here and there. The only thing I
haven’t really planned for is <a
href="https://v2.ocaml.org/manual/effects.html">something like
effects</a>, but I figured we can wait for others to figure out how
those work.</p>
<p>To that end, I’d like to start using CalVer with some semantic bits
here, basically a year and a patch level; the higher the patch level,
the more recent the release. Everything should be stable, and anything
breaking should be a bug report. Additionally, I’d like to have release
candidates for when we’re going to make the next release, so that folks
can start to test things. I was <a
href="https://lobste.rs/s/ynhu2s/effver_version_your_code_by_effort">thinking
about this based on a lobste.rs story about EffVer</a>; I almost
<strong>don’t want</strong> upgrades to be effort, I want them to be as
smooth as possible. This is something like Golang’s notion of "there
will never be golang 2:" basically, I think features should really nest
and compose nicely, and if they don’t, I need to reconsider the new
feature, not the old one.</p>
<p>So, versions of coastML should be something like <code>YYYY.P</code>
where:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>YYYY</code> is the four digit year, such as
<code>2024</code> and</p></li>
<li><p><code>P</code> is a linear integer increasing with each
patch</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I’d also maybe reserve a <code>.M</code> for folks who need SemVer
and also may have to make modifications to their SemVer distribution of
coastML, but for our purposes, it should be not directly important.
Additionally, for most years, I’d prefer if <code>.P</code> was just
<code>0</code>, if we need to even cut a release at all. I suspect most
years it will be external environmental changes, but who knows.</p>
<h2 id="_type_classes">type classes</h2>
<p>One other thing that I’ve decided on is that I’m going to stick with
type classes, similar to F# (and obviously Haskell). I thought for a
<strong>long, long time</strong> about this, and really appreciate the
simplicity they add. Yes, I know they can make debugging non-trivial,
but I am really interested in exploring them a bit more; I actually
wrote a document in the comments of the new compiler weighing out things
like:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>type classes</p></li>
<li><p>first-class modules</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>including Haskell Backpack, 1ML, &amp;c</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>F#-style or Go-style interfaces (F# has both interfaces and type
classes now)</p></li>
<li><p>Scala-style module implicits</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>and if we can smoosh together <code>type</code> implicits here as
well</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>rust-style traits (which aren’t too far off from type classes,
but still)</p></li>
<li><p>none of the above, just use generic multi-methods</p></li>
<li><p>none of those above, just keep everything monomorphic</p></li>
</ol>
<p>I thought on this for about a month, and decided I wanted to dive in
with type classes. This is a risk of course; I am still feeling the pain
of implementing two different types of type languages in carML, so
making a choice this big is a risk, but I figured if need be I can
always go back to this point and fork coastML into shoreML or Brooks or
the like.</p>
<h2 id="_type_vars">type vars</h2>
<p>I also have been thinking a lot about lexically-scoped type
variables: for example:</p>
<pre><code>foo = fn [A] x is A y is int {
    # ...
    bar = xx is A {
        # ...
    };
};</code></pre>
<p>I’d really like to be able to say if <code>A</code> is a fresh type
var or a known type without having to do any real type trickery. This
isn’t implemented yet, but it should be soon.</p>
<h2 id="_release_timeline">release timeline</h2>
<p>Let’s say we call the current status <code>2024.1-rc0</code>, here’s
what I would like to see in the next few releases of coastML</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><code>2024.1</code></p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>release of the new compiler</p></li>
<li><p>ad-hoc polymorphism (not <strong>really</strong>, but
still)</p></li>
<li><p><code>mod</code> compiles nicely (Carpet Python does not even
parse modules, but the new compiler does)</p></li>
<li><p>multi-case conditions like
<code>case x | 10 | 11 | 12 { print "somewhere in 10-12"; } | _ { print "something else"; } esac</code></p></li>
<li><p>better case guard conditions, like nested ADTs:
<code>case foo | (SomeType.Bar 10) …​ esac;</code></p></li>
<li><p>Python output for the new compiler</p>
<ol type="i">
<li><p>and better output; currently Carpet Python can’t correctly handle
<code>a = case (foo 10) | …​ esac;</code></p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>complete type checking</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><code>2024.2</code> (or even <code>2025.1</code> if need be)</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>new supported syntax for <code>types</code> to mirror calling
them</p></li>
<li><p>potentially something like SRFI-9 or SRFI-57 with inheritance
from a top-level CTOR</p>
<ol type="i">
<li><p>Implicits would be nice there, but…​</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>type classes</p></li>
<li><p>add at least one more language: QBE, C, JS, Java, Golang,
Rust</p>
<ol type="i">
<li><p>Carpet Python currently has a nascent JS generator, but it’s
definitely not even where the Python compiler is</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><code>2024.3</code> (or even <code>2026.1</code> if need be)</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p><code>box</code> types (for mutable values, like OCaml)</p></li>
<li><p>Hoare Logic and a light-weight prover (CAS)</p></li>
<li><p><code>rho</code> types (for row polymorphism)</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>Other considerations:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>I think the <code>easc</code> and <code>epyt</code> Algol-style
block ends are neat, but in practice they’re a pain to type and
remember: I don’t have syntax highlighting so it’s not great to see a
matching pair</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>I’m on the fence as to how we implement this: the easiest is
<code>case …​ end</code> and <code>type …​ end</code>, but it might be
nice to turn <code>case</code> in a block (i.e. <code>{ }</code>)
consumer</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>I think <code>is</code> should have a operator type of
<code>::</code> so <code>foo is int</code> and <code>bar :: int</code>
should mean the same thing</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>also <code>is</code> and <code>::</code> should be usable in code
itself to restrict polymorphism or the like</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>So hopefully you’ll join me on the coast.</p>
