# Learn carML in 5 years

I started working on [carML](https://github.com/lojikil/carML) on
19-MAR-2016, and much has changed since that time. I thought it would be
fun to recap what I've done and where it has been since that time.

## What is it?

carML is a tiny, ML-dialect that I've been sorta poking around on for the
last 5 years. It is meant to be:

- small
- easily understood
- with minimal barrier to entry
- and no ceiling

I use it sometimes for client work, esp with the new Golang support, and
it's been interesting. I've been really lazy about adding things as well;
I know it's not really a compiler currently, I mostly code things carefully
to avoid the edge cases I know exist, &c and so on.

Even with that, I've noticed simple composability with `|>`, `match` forms,
and nicer types make it nicer to program in than C or Golang directly for
certain things. The ability to express things with a `match` is quite nice,
esp for pattern matching.

## Being brave enough to release something you care about

One other note that is important (to me): carML is the first time that
I released a language that I'm working on in real time. This isn't even
the first time I've written a language with similar syntax: the first
time I toyed with this sort of thing was around 2003:

- [2006: 325m^2](https://github.com/lojikil/carML/blob/master/docs/325m2.txt)
- [2003: cML](https://github.com/lojikil/carML/blob/master/docs/cml-README.md)

## OCaml to Scala

Originally, carML used very OCaml-y types. This lead to very long type
signatures like: `ref of ref of array of int`, which of course makes sense
but is difficult to parse. The other side of it was that I originally made
the latter part _optional_; I wanted to support things like `ref` when a
user just wanted to use a pointer of some type. However, this lead to
**lots** of parsing code, and made a mess of things. Eventually, I gave
in and moved to a fairly clean Scala-style for types, enclosed with `[]`.
So the above becomes `ref[ref[array[int]]]`, and is relatively easy to
parse.

The other side of this was I wanted to clearly distinguish user types from
system types. [Tulip](https://github.com/tulip-lang/tulip/blob/master/examples/lazy.tlp) does this with `.tag`, but I decided to go with `Tag` style.
This would mean that all user types and constructors need to be
capitalized, but it saved on any confusion we may have as to what the next
form needed to be: we either have an array literal (such as 
`Either[int string]`) or we have another form, and the type is finished. 

Despite these things, the language is still fairly ML-y; I'm working on
modules and row typing to make things a little nicer, and that should
help too.

## Standard ML accessors... for everything

Sometimes I have epiphanies; one day I was thinking about something 
[deech](https://twitter.com/deech) said about tuples and product types.
I realized that there's not *really* much of a difference between:

- Structs
- ADTs
- and tuples

Save for how we define & access them, but there *needn't* be. I started
to look into this, and realized that Standard ML already does this. There
is a [nice comparison by Danny Gratzer](https://jozefg.bitbucket.io/posts/2015-04-24-sml-for-haskellers.html) that covers it. Still, I'm keeping
Scheme roots, and working with the usual combination of

- [SRFI-17](https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-17/srfi-17.html): generalized `set!`
- [SRFI-9](https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-9/srfi-9.html): record types
- [SRFI-57](https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-57/srfi-57.html): records

*as well as* drawing lots of insporation from the various "Successor ML"
dialects floating around, like [Morel](https://github.com/julianhyde/morel).

# The next five years to come

There's still a [lot of TODOs](https://github.com/lojikil/carML/blob/master/docs/todo.md) for what I want to achieve; next up after I fix 
[self-TCO](https://github.com/lojikil/carML/blob/master/src/self_tco.c.carml), I'll focus on adding some nice modules and top-level functions, as well
as a real compiler. 

More than enough for five more years.
