== two months of coastal living: coastML at two months

Today marks two months of coastal living; let's checkout the running burndown chart:

* [x] assignments
* [x] functions
* [x] `case` forms
** [ ] thread assignments into `case` forms (e.g. `a = case x ...` becomes `case x | ... { a = ... }`)
* [x] `type` forms
* [x] Python generation
* [x] decomposition in `case` forms
** [x] including pattern matching
** [ ] array pattern matching
** [ ] string pattern matching (this could get interesting...)
* [x] accessors (both variables and lambdas) for `type`
* [ ] `gn` forms
* [ ] `fc` forms
* [ ] `mod` and `sig` forms
* [ ] an analog to SML's `op`, using backticks
* [ ] basis library (stubbed out, need to actually compile)
** [x] basic basis stubs: some members of `array-*`, `string-*` have been stubbed out
** [ ] basis library modules (modular forms, e.g. `array-get` becomes `Array::get`)
* [ ] code generation
** [ ] C 
** [ ] C++
** [ ] Go
* [ ] type inference
* [ ] refinement types
* [ ] a compiler
** [ ] lambda lifter
** [ ] closure conversion
** [ ] `pragma` to control certain aspects of compilation
* bugs fixed
** [x] nested arrays `[[[1] [2]] [[3] [4]]]`
** [x] missing `/` character in identifier/operator character sets
** [x] floating point numbers with two integral digits (e.g. `0.12` and `1.12` worked but not `10.12`)

Not bad all told really, esp the bug fixes! This month, I plan on working on more of the compiler side, as well as more basis library functions. I'd
like to get some more basic programs out of the way, and maybe a C++ or Golang compiler as well, at least the start thereof.
